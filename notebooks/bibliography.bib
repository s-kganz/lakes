	abstract = {Information about lake morphometry (e.g., depth, volume, size, etc.) aids understanding of the physical and ecological dynamics of lakes, yet is often not readily available. The data needed to calculate measures of lake morphometry, particularly lake depth, are usually collected on a lake-by-lake basis and are difficult to obtain across broad regions. To span the gap between studies of individual lakes where detailed data exist and regional studies where access to useful data on lake depth is unavailable, we developed a method to predict maximum lake depth from the slope of the topography surrounding a lake. We use the National Elevation Dataset and the National Hydrography Dataset – Plus to estimate the percent slope of surrounding lakes and use this information to predict maximum lake depth. We also use field measured maximum lake depths from the US EPA’s National Lakes Assessment to empirically adjust and cross-validate our predictions. We were able to predict maximum depth for ,28,000 lakes in the Northeastern United States with an average crossvalidated RMSE of 5.95 m and 5.09 m and average correlation of 0.82 and 0.69 for Hydrological Unit Code Regions 01 and 02, respectively. The depth predictions and the scripts are openly available as supplements to this manuscript.},

	abstract = {The volume and depth of a lake are basic properties that greatly affect a wide array of its physical, chemical, and biological properties. Nevertheless, volume and depth data are scarce in lake-rich regions of the world. We coupled the Swedish lake register to GIS-derived geographical and topographical parameters, attempting to predict the volume and depth of 6943 lakes from map-derived parameters only. Lake area and the maximum slope in a 50 m wide zone outside of the lake shoreline were the most important predictors of both lake volume and depth, explaining 92\% of the variance in lake volume but ˂40\% of the variance in both maximum and mean depth. Regression parameters of regional submodels of lake volume were similar across geographically and topographically different regions, indicating that the model probably is applicable for glacially formed lakes in general. Despite the high degree of explanation for lake volume, the uncertainty in predicted volume for a single lake is considerable (relative standard deviation, ±57\%). However, the mean or cumulative lake volume of catchments containing several lakes (n {\textgreater} 15) is predictable from map-derived parameters with a greatly reduced uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Estimating the distribution of water across the landscape is critical to understanding how local aquatic biogeochemical processes may upscale to regional or continental scales. Whereas technology to estimate the areal extent of inland waters has improved dramatically, predictions of lake bathymetry still rely primarily on correlations with lake area that lack a mechanistic underpinning. Using topographically diverse regions of Quebec (Canada), we developed a model for predicting lake volume and depth that relies on geographic data that are widely available, which can be easily adapted to other regions. We found that the average change in relief between the surrounding terrestrial landscape and the lake surface to be the best predictor of bathymetric properties (lake volume, lake depth). Unlike previous models, our method provides a clear mechanistic link between relief outside and within the perimeter of a lake that is supported by basic geographic principles. This model will be useful in estimating the volumetric distribution of water as well as the distribution of lake depth, which are integral to our understanding of biological and geochemical lake processes.},

	abstract = {The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model Version 3 (GDEM v3) was evaluated over the conterminous United States in a manner similar to the validation conducted for the original GDEM Version 1 (v1) in 2009 and GDEM Version 2 (v2) in 2011. The absolute vertical accuracy of GDEM v3 was calculated by comparison with more than 23,000 independent reference geodetic ground control points from the U.S. National Geodetic Survey. The root mean square error (RMSE) measured for GDEM v3 is 8.52 meters. This compares with the RMSE of 8.68 meters for GDEM v2. Another important descriptor of vertical accuracy is the mean error, or bias, which indicates if a DEM has an overall vertical offset from true ground level. The GDEM v3 mean error of -1.20 meters reflects an overall negative bias in GDEM v3. The absolute vertical accuracy assessment results, both mean error and RMSE, were segmented by land cover type to provide insight into how GDEM v3 performs in various land surface conditions. While the RMSE varies little across cover types (6.92 to 9.25 meters), the mean error (bias) does appear to be affected by land cover type, ranging from -2.99 to +4.16 meters across 14 land cover classes. These results indicate that in areas where built or natural aboveground features are present, GDEM v3 is measuring elevations above the ground level, a condition noted in assessments of previous GDEM versions (v1 and v2) and an expected condition given the type of stereo-optical image data collected by ASTER. GDEM v3 was also evaluated by differencing with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) dataset. In many forested areas, GDEM v3 has elevations that are higher in the canopy than SRTM. The overall validation effort also included an evaluation of the GDEM v3 water mask. In general, the number of distinct water polygons in GDEM v3 is much lower than the number in a reference land cover dataset, but the total areas compare much more closely.},

	abstract = {Lake depth is an important characteristic for understanding many lake processes, yet it is unknown for the vast majority of lakes globally. Our objective was to develop a model that predicts lake depth using map-derived metrics of lake and terrestrial geomorphic features. Building on previous models that use local topography to predict lake depth, we hypothesized that regional differences in topography, lake shape, or sedimentation processes could lead to region-specific relationships between lake depth and the mapped features. We therefore used a mixed modeling approach that included region-specific model parameters. We built models using lake and map data from LAGOS, which includes 8164 lakes with maximum depth (Zmax) observations. The model was used to predict depth for all lakes ≥4 ha (n = 42 443) in the study extent. Lake surface area and maximum slope in a 100 m buffer were the best predictors of Zmax. Interactions between surface area and topography occurred at both the local and regional scale; surface area had a larger effect in steep terrain, so large lakes embedded in steep terrain were much deeper than those in flat terrain. Despite a large sample size and inclusion of regional variability, model performance (R2 = 0.29, RMSE = 7.1 m) was similar to other published models. The relative error varied by region, however, highlighting the importance of taking a regional approach to lake depth modeling. Additionally, we provide the largest known collection of observed and predicted lake depth values in the United States.},
